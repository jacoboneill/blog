# Learn Go with Tests

***Learn Go with Tests*** is a book about learning Go following the TDD philosophy *"Red, Green, Refactor"*. I though this would be a great book for myself to work through for my [ssgo](https://www.github.com/jacoboneill/ssgo) project as I wanted to practice my TDD and Go development with that project and get this blog online.

I found the book while scrolling through TikTok and YouTube and thought I would give it a go. This is going to be a lot longer of a post than I typically do. So here is the tl;dr, otherwise enjoy!

## Introduction

The introduction does a lot of things for the reader, it explains how the writer has tried to teach developers Go using a myriad of techniques, none of them working quite as well as they would hope. On top of this, it explains how developers are reluctant to do TDD as it adds more work (my friend who works in QA has also mentioned this). They then go on to explain how to install Go (on MacOS it is as simple as `brew install go`). They then go on to explain the tools that Go comes with (`go mod` for setting up modules, `go fmt` for formatting code). We then go on to writing some code.
